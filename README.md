# CudaConvolutionalReverb

This project executed convolutional reverb using four different techniques.

## Naive convolution on the cpu
This project can be found under **cpuConv**

## FFT convolution on the cpu
This project can be found under **FINALTESTFFT**

## Naive convolution on the gpu
This project can be found under **gpuConv**

## FFT convolution on the gpu
This project can be found under **FINALCUFFT**

# Extra
There are some python scripts that help visualize a spectra and convolude signals from txt files along with some images of the audio and impulse response spectrum under **helperScript**.
